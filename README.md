# Hobby Huddle - Front End

Hobby Huddle tackles the challenge of connecting eager learners with local mentors and teachers. This platform fills the gap by providing a centralized hub where individuals seeking to learn new skills can easily find and engage with experienced mentors who tailor to their interests. Simultaneously, it offers teachers a space to showcase their talents and host sessions, while enabling vendors to promote their venues for workshops. 

Whether you're seeking unique skills or aiming to share your passion, Hobby Huddle is rooted in building communities and bringing learning and teaching opportunities to your neighborhood.
